# "I put the "run time modifying" stuff (PATH and friends) in .profile, so that these things are also easily available outside interactive Bash sessions, like non-interactive Bash sessions, other command line shells sessions and even the graphical shell/desktop environment. The .profile file should be loaded on login on Linux setups."
